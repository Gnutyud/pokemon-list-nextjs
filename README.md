# Pokémon List

This project implements a Pokémon List page using **Next.js** version **14**. The application displays a paginated list of Pokémon that can be filtered by type, utilizing the **PokéAPI** for data fetching.

## Features

- **Pokémon List**: Displays a list of Pokémon with images and names.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination to navigate through the Pokémon list.
- **Type Filtering**: Allows users to filter Pokémon based on their types.

## Requirements

- Build a page to display a list of Pokémon using Next.js version 14.
- Ensure the code is clean and well-organized.
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Utilize server-side components to enhance performance.
- Reference the [PokéAPI Documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) for data fetching.
